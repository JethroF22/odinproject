My attempt at a mock Google home page for the Odin project.

By the end of this project, I want to have done both the front page and the results page from Google. Here are the learning goals of the project:

 - Two ways to move a div around on the page
 - Stick a div onto the bottom or top of the page
 - Identify the background color of an existing webpage
 - Grab the URL for an image from an existing webpage
 - Center an element horizontally
 - Identify three ways you can include your CSS styles in a page
 - Understand how to use classes and ids to target CSS at specific elements on the page
 - Build a very basic form (even if it doesn't "go" anywhere)

 I feel like I'll have to spend the most time with the CSS positioning tasks.

 Partial success is recreating the Google front page. Full success also means recreating a decent version of the results page (with lorem ipsum).
