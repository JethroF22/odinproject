Pomodoro clock has three main variables:
- time til next ding
- on/off state
- whether it's on a work phase or break phase

As the page first loads, these variables are set to:
time: 25 minutes
state: off
phase: work

Then there should be a button for the user to click "start".
This will start counting down 25 minutes.
There could be some sort of message encouraging the user to keep focused
for 25 minutes.
There should also be a clock counting down.

Assuming no interaction from the user, once the clock hits 0
a ding is heard. The phase then switches to break and the timer
is reset to 5 minutes.

This remains indefinitely, with a ding and change of phase
every time the timer gets to 0.

There are two actions the user can take: pause and stop.
Pause maintains the phase and time count, it just doesn't count
down. Stop changes state to off, time to 25 and phase to work.
